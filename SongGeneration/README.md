## Overview

We develop the SongGeneration model. It is an LM-based framework consisting of **LeLM** and a **music codec**. LeLM is capable of parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. The music codec reconstructs the dual-track tokens into highfidelity music audio. SongGeneration significantly improves over the open-source music generation models and performs competitively with current state-of-the-art industry systems. For more details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07520).

## Installation

### Start from scatch

You can install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file with Python>=3.8.12 and CUDA>=11.8:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_nodeps.txt --no-deps
```

Then install flash attention from git. For example, if you're using Python 3.10 and CUDA 12.0

```bash
pip install https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Start with docker

```bash
docker pull juhayna/song-generation-levo:hf0613
docker run -it --gpus all --network=host juhayna/song-generation-levo:hf0613 /bin/bash
```

### Other deploy examples 

 - Windows platform with ComfyUI: https://github.com/smthemex/ComfyUI_SongGeneration
 - Windows installer: http://bilibili.com/video/BV1ATK8zQE8L/?vd_source=22cfc54298226c4161b1aff457d17585


## Inference

To ensure the model runs correctly, **please download all the required folders** from the original source at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/waytan22/SongGeneration).

- Save the `ckpt` and `third_party` folder into the **root directory** of the project
- Save the the model's `ckpt` and `yaml` files into your desired checkpoint directory: `ckpt_path`ÔºàWe provide multiple versions of model checkpoints. Please choose the version that best fits your needs and download the corresponding `ckpt` and `yaml` files accordingly.Ôºâ

Once everything is set up, you can run the inference script using the following command:

```bash
sh generate.sh ckpt_path lyrics.jsonl output_path
```

If your GPU has less than 30GB or you encounter Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors, run the following command:

```bash
sh generate_lowmem.sh ckpt_path lyrics.jsonl output_path
```

- You may provides sample inputs in JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) format. Each line represents an individual song generation request. The model expects each input to contain the following fields:

  - `idx`: A unique identifier for the output song. It will be used as the name of the generated audio file.
  - `gt_lyric`:The lyrics to be used in generation. It must follow the format of `[Structure] Text`, where `Structure` defines the musical section (e.g., `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`). See Input Guide.
  - `descriptions` : (Optional) You may customize the text prompt to guide the model‚Äôs generation. This can include attributes like gender, timbre, genre, emotion, instrument, and BPM. See Input Guide.
  - `prompt_audio_path`: (Optional) Path to a 10-second reference audio file. If provided, the model will generate a new song in a similar style to the given reference.

  - `auto_prompt_audio_type`: (Optional) Used only if `prompt_audio_path` is not provided. This allows the model to automatically select a reference audio from a predefined library based on a given style. Supported values include:
    - `'Pop'`, `'R&B'`, `'Dance'`, `'Jazz'`, `'Folk'`, `'Rock'`,`'Chinese Style'`, `'Chinese Tradition'`, `'Metal'`, `'Reggae'`, `'Chinese Opera'`, `'Auto'`.
  - **Note:** If certain optional fields are not required, they can be omitted. 

- Outputs of the loader `output_path`:
  - `audio`: generated audio files
  - `jsonl`: output jsonls
  
- An example command may look like:
  
  ```
  sh generate_lowmem.sh ckpt/songgeneration_base sample/lyrics.jsonl sample/output
  ```

## Input Guide

An example input file can be found in `sample/lyrics.jsonl` 

### üéµ Lyrics Input Format

The `gt_lyric` field defines the lyrics and structure of the song. It consists of multiple musical section, each starting with a structure label. The model uses these labels to guide the musical and lyrical progression of the generated song.

#### üìå Structure Labels

- The following segments **should not** contain lyrics (they are purely instrumental):

  - `[intro-short]`, `[intro-medium]`, `[inst-short]`, `[inst-medium]`, `[outro-short]`, `[outro-medium]`

  > - `short` indicates a segment of approximately 0‚Äì10 seconds
  > - `medium` indicates a segment of approximately 10‚Äì20 seconds
  > - We find that [inst] label is less stable, so we recommend that you do not use it.

- The following segments **require lyrics**:

  - `[verse]`, `[chorus]`, `[bridge]`

#### üßæ Lyrics Formatting Rules

- Each section is **separated by ` ; `**

- Within lyrical segments (`[verse]`, `[chorus]`, `[bridge]`), lyrics must be written in complete sentences and separated by a period (`.`)

- A complete lyric string may look like:

  ```
  [intro-short] ; [verse] These faded memories of us. I can't erase the tears you cried before. Unchained this heart to find its way. My peace won't beg you to stay ; [bridge] If ever your truth still remains. Turn around and see. Life rearranged its games. All these lessons in mistakes. Even years may never erase ; [inst-short] ; [chorus] Like a fool begs for supper. I find myself waiting for her. Only to find the broken pieces of my heart. That was needed for my soul to love again ; [outro-short]
  ```

### üìù Description Input Format

The `descriptions` field allows you to control various musical attributes of the generated song. It can describe up to six musical dimensions: **Gender** (e.g., male, female), **Timbre** (e.g., dark, bright, soft), **Genre** (e.g., pop, jazz, rock), **Emotion** (e.g., sad, energetic, romantic), **Instrument** (e.g., piano, drums, guitar), **BPM** (e.g., the bpm is 120). 

- All six dimensions are optional ‚Äî you can specify any subset of them.

- The order of dimensions is flexible.

- Use **commas (`,`)** to separate different attributes.

- Although the model supports open vocabulary, we recommend using predefined tags for more stable and reliable performance. A list of commonly supported tags for each dimension is available in the `sample/description/` folder.

- Here are a few valid `descriptions` inputs:

  ```
  - female, dark, pop, sad, piano and drums, the bpm is 125.
  - male, piano, jazz.
  - male, dark, the bpm is 110.
  ```

### üéßPrompt Audio Usage Notes

- The input audio file can be longer than 10 seconds, but only the first 10 seconds will be used.
- For best musicality and structure, it is recommended to use the chorus section of a song as the prompt audio.
- You can use this field to influence genre, instrumentation, rhythm, and voice

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Avoid providing both `prompt_audio_path` and `descriptions` at the same time.**
  If both are present, and they convey conflicting information, the model may struggle to follow instructions accurately, resulting in degraded generation quality.
- If `prompt_audio_path` is not provided, you can instead use `auto_prompt_audio_type` for automatic reference selection.


## Tools
